The order maintenance problem (sometimes called "maintaining order in a list") is to maintain a data structure that offers the operations:

bool in_order(const node * x, const node * y): x and y must be pointers to nodes in the same list. Returns true when x precedes y in the list.
node * singleton(): creates a list with one node and returns a pointer to that node. Nodes are members of only one list.
node * insert_after(node * x): returns a pointer to a newly created node placed just after x.

and often:

void delete(node * x): removes the node x from the list it belongs to.

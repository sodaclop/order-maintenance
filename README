THIS LIBRARY IS NOT YET BETA QUALITY.

The order maintenance problem (sometimes called "maintaining order in a list") is to maintain a list with arbitrary insertions and deletions as well as order queries, which determine which of two nodes is closer to the head of the list. [4][14][15][17]

Trivially, linked lists can support these operations in O(1) time for updates and O(n) time for queries, and extensible arrays can support them O(n) time for updates and O(1) time for queries. The goal of this library is to provide faster operations. The asymptotically fastest published order maintenance structures support O(1) updates and queries.

This structure has many applications, including fully persistent data structures [5][16], ancestor queries in trees [4][13][15][18], partially persistent van Emde Boas trees [1], context trees [4], pattern matching in dynamic texts [2] and trees [3], adaptive programming [6] and self-adjusting computation [7], detecting race conditions [8], searching simplified graphs [9], graph drawing [10], data compression [11], and XML databases [12].
